# Queen-Attacks
In chess, the queen can attack an opponent from the same row, same column, or same diagonal. This program takes the position of the queen and opponent and determines if the queen can attack the piece. This chessboard containers no other pieces besides the queen and one opponent piece.

Input: The first line of input consists of two integers separated by spaces, representing the x and y positions of the queen. The second line of input consists of two integers separated by spaces, representing the x and y positions of the opponent. The Java Scanner class requires user input through the command line. 

Output: This program prints the string "Yes" if the queen can attack the oppononet piece. If not, it will print "No."
